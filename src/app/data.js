    {id: 0, name: '-Madeline C.', review:`"Vance was awesome to work with! He was up front about the work, kept me in the loop, and executed. We contracted Alignment Construction to replace a load bearing wall with a beam across the ceiling to open up our kitchen. He helped me work with the permitting office and kept me up to date on the construction progress. He kept the big picture in mind, but went the extra mile for the small details. An example of that was taking the time to match the beam's stain to our to be installed wood floor. If you want the job done right, Vance is the right fit."`},
    {id: 1, name: '-Kelly M.', review:`"Vance helped me with a structural wall removal in my house. He was super quick to respond to my initial inquiry and to come out and inspect the wall. He worked with my engineer, my budget, and my desired timeframe to make our vision come to life. Any updates or obstacles were well communicated and he answered every question I thought of. He and his team were very efficient and professional, and I wouldn't hesitate to hire Alignment Construction LLC again or recommend them to a friend."`},
    {id: 2, name: '-Bridget M.', review:`"What a great idea it was to contact Vance! We thought we had a load bearing wall that we've been wanting to remove. Vance quickly made time to come to our home with engineer Tom to check out the project. With some inspection, he gave us the fantastic news the wall was not load bearing. We were thrilled with his honesty and the fact that he didn't try to sell us work we could do ourselves. Would not hesitate to call Alignment Construction again for a project and have already referred neighbors to contact him for their load bearing wall needs."`},
    {id: 3, name: '-Lori B.', review:`"Absolutely impressive in all aspects of the work performed: good quality, on time, answered all questions and explained the process and finished the job per the plan. I would definitely use Vance at Alignment Construction for any future work!!"`}
